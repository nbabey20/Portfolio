        <p>I am 17 years old and from Phoenix, Arizona. I am an upcoming senior in Highschool and have always had an interest
            in technology and computers. I grew up playing computer games, so I naturally became intrigued with how programs and 
            applications work. I have taken a software development class in school that taught me basics in Java, AppInventor, and 
            some Visual Basic. My favorite subject in school is math and it's something I feel is fun to do because I enjoy problem solving.

        <p>My hobbies include playing video games, track and field, listening to music, hanging out with friends, watching football, and watching tiktoks for hours each day. 
            I am pretty relaxed and love to meet new people.
